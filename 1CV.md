					<h3>Drawings</h3>
				</header>
				<p>From digital paintings to watercolors, anything that could be used to represent my inner space is welcomed when I`m drawing. Though I`m not very good at it, I just like the feeling of creating. I usually draw cute and simple characters because of my lack of drawing skills. You can find more of my drawings in my instagram. </p>

					<h3>Bbang dduck</h3>
				</header>
				<p>This cute doll is not exactly a hobby but is the most important thing in the world to me. And this deserves a place in this website. Bbang dduck is a goroneko doll, and was named bbangdduck because of its soft touch. Anyone who has held bbang dduck falls in love with it because of course it is the cutest doll in the world. I`m really proud of being the owner of this adorable doll. </p>

					<h3>Reading</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Some may find reading a boring hobby. I mostly read Korean pure literature. We all know from when we are elementary students that Korean is a beautiful language, but it`s hard to feel it in our daily lives. If you read pure literature, you may feel the beauty of it thanks to the authors who could play with the words too well. My recomendation is 'Human Acts: A Novel' by Hangang.</p>

		<p>I am interested in a lot of things other than these three things like sleeping, watching anime, and listening to music. And I think I will have more hobbies as time goes on. </p>
